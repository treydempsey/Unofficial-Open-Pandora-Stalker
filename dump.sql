Production will start during the next days, probably on Monday. Then lots of Pandora cases should be spit out each day :)<BR>While they do this, we try to make them another Silkscreen sample and send us a picture of it (not the whole sample) within this week. If it''s fine, we''ll use the silkscreen - if not, we''ll just go with plain cases, to not waste anymore time.<BR><BR>As for the OS, the devs are really working hard on it right now (despite not having time, as they have so much things to do in real life).<BR>It will surely not be the most polished OS ever released yet, but if you want a polished OS, go get an Apple (and miss all the fun we''ll all have by enhancing the Pandora OS together!)<BR><BR>So, what can you expect, what will not work, where are tweaks needed?</P><P><STRONG><U>What does work: </U></STRONG></P><UL><LI>The desktop fully works. It''s like a normal PC desktop. You have your file manager, your windows, your apps, etc.Â </LI><LI>PND system is working. You can simply copy games onto your SD Card, put it into your Pandora - and PLAY!</LI><LI>Apps: Installed apps do work fine so far. That includes Midori, Abiword, Orage, Pidgin, XChat, etc.</LI><LI>Audio Playing: XMMS working fine.</LI><LI>Movie Playing: Working... but has some issues (see below)</LI><LI>USB Devices: You can connect USB Sticks, harddisks, mice, keyboard, etc. Normal things run out of the box.</LI><LI>TV Out: The TV Out cable works fine, SVHS only for the moment though (see below)</LI><LI>Power Saving Mode: Yep, it''s included and does work. At the moment, it should last for about 50 hours, not too long, but there might be a lot more components which could be switched off to save more power. Good enough to leave your Pandora lying around for a few hours without having to reboot it.</LI><LI>LED Warning (Blinking) on low battery with automatic shutdown when the battery status becomes critical.</LI><LI>Keyboard, us nub as mouse, touchscreen, everything working.</LI></UL><P><STRONG><U>What issues are there?</U></STRONG></P><UL><LI>The biggest issue: WiFi is still work in progress. The driver works, without using SDIO it was slow, DJWillis is working on it, but it''s time consuming. It MIGHT be ready when the Pandora ships, but it might be WiFi will still take a bit longer. Maybe some devs want to help out here once they get a Pandora in their hands :)</LI><LI>There''s no software audio mixer yet. This means you can only use the volume wheel. No big deal if you''re just listening to music or playing games, but multiple sounds at once will not work yet. Also, the equalizer isn''t yet working.</LI><LI>Some apps have to be optimized for the small screen: Fullscreen apps like Midori, Abiword, etc. do look fine. Some stuff however (XFCE4 Settings, etc.) are using windows bigger than 800x480. They are completely usable, but you have to move the windows around to access all buttons.</LI><LI>Movieplayer: While basic movie playing works, it does not use any hardware accelerations yet. DVD Quality xvid videos do play fine, but H264 is too much without hardware acceleration. Also, in windowed mode the videos are playing before the menus. Watching movies in fullscreen mode works nicely. Things should be way better when hardware support is included :)</LI><LI>There is a lot to tweak and optimize here and there. Bootup speed can be increased, more themes (fingerfriendly ones?) could be created, some minor issues like the normal logout of Ubuntu-Netbook-Launcher doesn''t work (you need to use a menu entry), etc. Nothing serious that makes the unit not usable, but there are a lot of things that can be improved within the next months!</LI></UL><P>So, except for WiFi, all things do work well so far but can be optimized a lot.<BR>Please don''t expect to have perfectly working games and emulators on day 1 - adopting to a new system will take some time and except for some core OS developers, nobody has a Pandora yet. Once delivered, games should start to pop up and become optimized pretty fast!</P><P>Some of that stuff might be fixed until first release - let''s hope for WiFi! :)Â </P><P><STRONG><U>Another quick note on updating the system:</U></STRONG></P><P>When things work fine, we''re going to setup our own repository server for firmware updates. You can then easily do a system update with the Pandora. The packages we use will be tested so that they shouldn''t break anything :)<BR>In the beginning, the updates will be full flash updates, until the basic system will be completely stable. Then we''ll Â setup the repository server (which basically means: Â when WiFi is working).</P><P>Everyone who wants to help us can do so. There will be a bugtracker for reporting any issues. The complete system is already available via GIT to all devs, so patches and bugfixes can basically be sent to us by everyone :)<BR>The first few months with the new OS will be pretty exciting! I''ve seen how well our handful of devs have been able to get the system working so well, it will fly away when a lot more devs are helping out!<BR></P>');

The ones that kept us going! The ones that laid their money into our hands to produce this great little machine! Thanks!</P><P>Â </P><P><STRONG>So, what will happen next?Â </STRONG></P><P>We don''t even know yet how many cases the chinese factory is able to produce until the new year or IF they are even Â able to produce them, however, the most important thing is that nothing needs to be changed anymore. So in worst case, they start the mass production after their new years break which is February 22nd. Not a big deal after waiting for such a long time.</P><P>Of course, once this starts, we''ll try to finish your Pandoras as fast as possible. Will be a few weeks, I guess, as we shouldn''t forget about shipping. The cases need to be shipped from China to America (takes a few days). After the Mass production, they need to be shipped to us (takes a few days as well) and from there they need to be shipped to you.<BR><BR>We''ll keep you informed about what happens as usual.<BR>As most work is going on with the OS right now, I''ll set up a status page with what has to be done and what has been done for the OS soon.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P><STRONG>Want to shake hands or talk with me?Â </STRONG></P><P>You all do know me from the boards, I guess. However, if you want to meet me in real life: I''ll be at the CeBIT in Hannover, Germany on March 6th. From 12pm - 1pm I''ll be doing a presentation about OpenSource gaming handhelds. Of course, I''ll have the Pandora with me. So if you happen to be there, why not join us there? I''ll be posting more information about this soon.</P><P><BR></P>');

But that was what happened.</P><P>The cases did arrive on Friday, not as expected today. While this usually is a good thing, we were shocked by the quality - just look at the pictures which float around at the boards and you''ll agree with us. The bad thing about timezones is: When Michael did get those cases, it was too late to call up the chinese factory to find out what went wrong.</P><P>So a lot of turbulences did happen at the boards - which was perfectly understandable. As said, we also were shocked.</P><P>However, it looks like this is another thing did learn: Injection mould samples will always look that bad if it''s just a bunch of them.</P><P>After recovering from the shock, we started to investigate and think about what just happened. To be honest I didn''t think this could possibly look like the final product. Come on, what kind of company would survive for 12 years if they produce cracked and cheap looking products to their customers. No, there HAD to be something we didn''t know.</P><P>Then some guys at the board who do work in injection moulding business did tell us a bit more. I also talked to some other guys via ICQ - and got the same replies from all of them: Doing a proper injection moulding run needs a lot of time. The machine has to heaten up completely (which usually needs a few hours) and the mould has to be aligned properly, which also does take some time. As this would mean the machine couldn''t be used for mass production at that time (which is a loss of money) they usually don''t let it heaten up completely.</P><P>As the plastic tends to keep sticking inside of the mould if not fully heated, they add a bit more grease. Otherwise, they''d have to manually remove the plastic which could damage the mould - and that''s definately not good.</P><P>Another thing was that they might''ve used recycled plastic for the samples. Why use the expensive plastic when it''s just samples that won''t be used at all anyways? That''s why there were discolorations and the case was looking greasy. As the finishing usually also isn''t applied, it looks scratched.Â </P><P>So as that did calm us down a bit, we had to wait until Fatihs friend could call up the factory today.</P><P>And guess what: I looks like this was EXACTLY the case. The samples were just meant to check if everything fits. The final mass production cases will be properly heated and cooled down and will get a nice finishing.

As he could speak with them in their native language, a lot of things cleared up.</P><P>When they were talking about "soon", it didn''t mean what we did understand as "soon". Â "Soon" did mean "as soon as we''re finished.". Regardless, how long that will take. So each time they said us "We''ll soon have pictures", we assumed they will follow the next few days - which didn''t happen.</P><P>Another thing we found out is when they said "We''re finished and will do some testing injections", they didn''t mean they were finished with ALL our changes, but they finished ONE thing on the to-do-list and Â did a test injection to see if that was fine. That''s why we got some shipping dates which never happened - and with us wondering why they didn''t tell us. They sent us emails with stuff like "We fixed it all and will do the next samples on Friday". We then thought, okay, the next samples will ship on Friday. However, as we now do know, it meant they finished another step on those days and made an internal testing injection to find out if everything is okay. It wouldn''t have made sense to ship us those half-finished cases (it would just have cost a lot of money). And that''s the reason why they didn''t tell us that they didn''t ship... they never planned to ship it ;)<BR></P><P>It''s really interesting what can happen if business partners do speak completely different languages as native language.</P><P>So much for the background "What happened". Now onto the more interesting stuff: What WILL happen?</P><P>One thing we did understand correctly was that their goal is to have the mass-produced cased finished and shipped until the chinese new year!<BR>We now do know that they did finish the last tweaks on the case mould, the silkscreen and the keyboard mould (which still had one mis-aligned letter). And with finished, I do mean REALLY finished. Not just another step, but all steps. This does mean they''ll ship the final samples within the next days. They are VERY positive they are perfect, so as soon as they shipped out everything, they prepare the mass production. So as soon as we get the samples and approve it, mass production will start. As they can produce 1000 cases a day and we need 4000 for the first batch, this can happen within four days. That should work out just before the chinese new year!</P><P>I know it does sound a lot like stuff you already heard before - but this time, we were talking with them in their native language, so I assume it will be much more accurate than anything before!</P><P>Â </P>');

The nice thing about it is that it does support finger scrolling. It might not make it into the first release, but I doubt it will take long until it will be included into an update.

It&#39;s running at 800 * 480. A lot of people were in the party and they played with Pandora a lot.

If it&#39;s hardware and can&#39;t be fixed easily, will you ship the first 1000 with a view to replacing them later, or are we dead in the water until the hw issue is fixed?</div></div><br />
<br />
Depends :) If we know it before we ship, we&#39;re gonna let you decide.<br />
You could probably get it right away and pay a bit less for a non-WiFi unit, get it right away with the option to exchange it later (second batch maybe) or wait for a fixed unit and let someone else get it.<br />
If it&#39;s fixable and we know the fix before we ship, we&#39;re going to do it right away.<br />

And I think you can survive without ext4.</div></div><br />
I have absolutely no doubt about that, but given the timeframe I&#39;d say there&#39;s probably been plenty of time to switch upwards in the list, at least a version or 2. Keep in mind that .27 was released in October 2008. And as for me and ext4, I love it specifically because of extents, and it was introduced (not ext4dev, but ext4) in .29 I believe. Incidentally, that kernel also provided the final stability nail for the ath5k driver, so I have an unnatural attachment to it. Sure I can live without ext4, but having to reformat an ext2 card to ext4 later is going to be a hassle. I know you can just mount it as ext4, but my experience with that has been that it doesn&#39;t do jack for performance and kept on trucking with large indirect block tables instead of extents, which absolutely kills performance on my crappy hard disks at least.<br />
tl;dr: my external hard disk went from 21MB/s to 30MB/s avg. write speed simply from switching from ext3 to ext4 (and runs at 12-15MB/s on FAT32/NTFS). I of course have no idea whether the SDHC card bus will limit my class 4 card or the card/filesystem will</div></div><br />
<br />
Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll upgrade to a newer version with a future firmware update. We want to have hardware accelerated movie-playing after all&#33;<br />
<br />
However, except for the hardware acceleration, the current OS is stable and runs pretty well (tested for over one month now&#33;)<br />
If we switch NOW, it might break things we couldn&#39;t fix until we assemble.<br />
Now, what would happen if the first people get the Pandora with non-working WiFi so far and non-working OS? ;) <br />
<br />
We&#39;d rather have a solid base OS now and then concentrate on updating.<br />
Everyone can help testing future firmware images, as you can boot them from SD Card.<br />
So it shouldn&#39;t take too long until you will have a new kernel.<br />
<br />
You can always compile a newer one for yourself and see if it works fine with your unit, too, if you want.

Yes, I am alright. I&#39;m still waiting for some responds from the other guys, regarding how exactly we will handle everything.<br />
<br />
The blog post most likely wouldn&#39;t have more information than I wrote here on the page anyways, just some more confirmed things.<br />
<br />
We had a long night yesterday in IRC where we thought about all possible issues how to find out what could cause the slow speed.<br />
Michael is going to modify a board to be able to read out the debug data from the module itself, that might also help a lot.<br />
<br />
Regarding the first boards produced: As it looks like right now, Michael will test the debug output and then we&#39;ll either let the boards we have already ship immediately (if he doesn&#39;t find more about it) or will let them apply a fix if he finds out it&#39;s hardware and it can be fixed easily.<br />
That&#39;s the last thing we can try out pretty quick, if it won&#39;t help, it&#39;s shipping and assembling time&#33;<br />
<br />
So yes, we&#39;re working on it. The fewer we post, the more busy we are with it.<br />
It will be solved, that&#39;s something we are sure about. We won&#39;t give up&#33;

Looks like hundreds (or at least dozens) of some of these parts. If the case company is now producing these on a different machine (new, as in newly bought by the company, or new as in a different one they hadn&#39;t tried our moulds on before), what happens to all these old parts? <br />
<br />
Did we pay for them? Do they dump them? Can we get them to see quality?

Those were the testing cases. They are done to check if everything is okay and going well and big production can be started.<br />
Usually, that plastic is being melted after doing that (remember the weird-colored looking first samples we got? Those came from preused plastic).

We just hoped that we could get it working until then. Michael is a very careful guy - so he wanted to check once more.

<br />
WiFi was the only thing where our couldn&#39;t get the driver fully working.<br />
We hoped it would work out until now, and things got better. We can get stable speeds without packet loss, but we don&#39;t know yet why it&#39;s slow.<br />
<br />
Every other aspect (nubs, Audio, 3D processor, keyboard, screen, DPad, SD-Card slots, USB-connector, TV Out, charger, etc.) are working fine as we are working with all that already on our units for months.<br />
<br />
We still hope it&#39;s a software issue, but who could tell it is for sure until you get it to work 100%?<br />
<br />
One thing we don&#39;t want to do is hide that from you, so we didn&#39;t want to silently build the Pandoras and ship them to you, telling it can&#39;t possibly be hardware, and then later it might turn out it IS hardware indeed.<br />
<br />
I know other companies probably wouldn&#39;t have cared about that and simply delivered...<br />
But I do think this project is based on trust. I trust you guys will support us if we openly tell you what&#39;s happening.<br />
Even if we find out it&#39;s hardware within the next days, I do think being open about it is the right way to go. The way to keep you guys supporting us.<br />
<br />
We are no big company with billions of USD nor are we magicians, we cannot snip with our fingers and make WiFi working.<br />
All we can do is offer to assemble and ship the units we have right now and fix it later, so you can finally start using your Pandora and know this last thing will be taken care of.<br />
<br />
If it turns out to be wrong - and you&#39;d all immediately abandon the project because we told you of problems instead of silently ship it anyways... it would really hurt me a lot.<br />
For me, this community is the coolest one I&#39;ve ever seen. It always kept me motivated to work on the Archive, the website, the server in my free time and to open up a shop to make sure you can easily buy such handhelds with the best customer support I can possibly provide.<br />
I never charged anything for let you use the archives nor for hosting this website (and yes, it does cost me money).<br />
It&#39;s what I want to give to the community, as the community gave me a lot of cool games and apps for all the open handhelds.<br />
<br />
And I still do think that if you help someone, he will also help you when you&#39;re in need. So let&#39;s go on and play with out Pandoras soon&#33; :D

How is Openpandora going to pay for 4000x 150e ( I dunno the exact price, it might be more) for each new board? Or do you have to wait a year for a new board if it seems to be a hw issue</div></div><br />
<br />
If it turns out to be a hardware thing, it could be that only a resistor or capacitor needs to be changed. The GP2X First Edition had the same problem - I remember fixing 200 a few months after delivery...<br />
<br />
If the board REALLY needs to be exchanged, you don&#39;t need to calculate the full costs - because there might also be people who would love to get a board without working WiFi for a few bucks less. So all we need would be the money to compensate that.<br />
<br />
<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>2. What is the chance of this being a hw issue (cause everything seems to be working from here as someone who reads the boards, but it seems to be working just not good enough.</div></div><br />
<br />
Hard to tell, it&#39;s similar to playing lottery. We&#39;re doing all we can to find this out right now. Michael bought more equipment to do some more in-depth measurements and he also asked the module manufacturer if they have any idea.<br />
We&#39;ll let you know as soon as we get more information about it.<br />
<br />
<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>3. Do you promise youll give us a new board?</div></div><br />
<br />
Well, a hard thing to promise :) <br />
If we all die because of a heart attack before that, we can&#39;t do that. If everyone cancels from one day to the next it might also be hard for us coughing up the money to do that.<br />
You can be sure if it&#39;s somehow possible for use, yes, we&#39;ll do that.<br />
It might take a bit until we sold enough units to cover all the costs (we&#39;re not Sony, you know), but as said above, if [I&#39;m stupid spammer] the non-WiFi-Units a bit cheaper, it shouldn&#39;t be too much.<br />
Fingers crossed it&#39;s not necessary at all, for sure&#33;<br />
<br />
<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>4. Cant you make a small setup to test if its a hw issue or sw issue?</div></div><br />
<br />
I think that&#39;s what Michael is planning to do - but the board needs a bit of a change for that, so it needs a few weeks until he can do so.<br />
Until then, we don&#39;t want to stop delivery... would be wasted time if it&#39;s really just a software issue, and as you can see by the responses and polls, there are quite a few people who are fine with that solution. Ship, find out what&#39;s the cause and fix it.<br />

We&#39;re discussing about how exactly we&#39;ll manage everything and finding out how quick we can now get all the produced boards and cases to UK (yes, we stopped the shipment of the boards because of WiFi - Michael first wanted to check once more if there is something wrong with the hardware and maybe find a very simple fix they could apply before shipping).<br />
But as we&#39;re not sure yet what&#39;s causing it, no need to hold back and keep you waiting anymore. We&#39;re now trying to get the stuff as quickly to UK as possible so you can start playing - and fix it if it&#39;s really broken.

Exactly. We sure hope it&#39;s not a hardware thing, as it would mean quite a lot of work and some more cost for us... but there&#39;s no need to let you all wait.<br />

The problem is, you can never be 100% sure if it&#39;s hardware or not when you don&#39;t have the software properly working yet. As we don&#39;t want to lie to you, we surely cannot promise :) <br />
All we know is that the module gets everything according to specs (Michael checked it) and does initialize and work so far (though slowly). It does report the Signal strength and Link Quality correctly, so the antenna also seems to be fine :) <br />
<br />
However, we have no money to pay a team to get WiFi working. And to not let you wait for too long, we decided we&#39;d go this way.<br />
You can either wait until we completely fixed it, but we cannot tell how long you will have to wait yet.<br />
Or you can get it right away including a dongle so you get a full functional Pandora including a minimal WiFi dongle which surely won&#39;t get in your way - starting delivery in April. And if there really is something wrong (as said, there&#39;s always a chance), we offer to fix it.

<br />
Well, the module initializes and talks to the board, that&#39;s what we know for sure.<br />
<br />
One thing I can promise: If it REALLY turns out to be a hardware fault, you can be sure we&#39;ll either fix it for you or exchange your board for free as soon as we can afford it (maybe after the second batch, when we got some money back).<br />
So either way, you won&#39;t be screwed. (I remember I had to fix over 200 gp2x First Editions as they had a flickering LCD...)<br />
<br />
We just wanted to make an offer that you can use WiFi right from the start, that&#39;s why we want to offer you a small WiFi dongle and your Pandora NOW.

Fatih agreed and they did a new test today and according to them, it does a MUCH better quality). Can&#39;t wait for the pictures.<br />
Shipping and production will happen this week, so yeah, we lost a few days for assembly, but got much better cases.<br />
<br />
About the WiFi... well, we&#39;re currently discussing things and will do the blog post (finally&#33;) when we decided everything (hopefully tonight).<br />
<br />
We&#39;ll probably let you decide if you want your Pandora NOW (and we might even throw in a free mini-WiFi-Stick so you can use WiFi with your Pandora&#33;) or wait until everything is sorted out. And when I mean YOU, I&#39;m not talking about a public discussion - every single customer can decide if he wants it now with stick or wait until internal WiFi is sorted out.<br />

Yep, we don&#39;t want to keep you waiting anymore.

Yeah, that makes sense.  I forgot that they are cables and not just adapters.<br />
So have you officially decided to include both the hard and soft cases?  or do we have to pick?</div></div><br />

I think I said last time the original (hard) case was pretty shitty quality. That&#39;s why we decided to use another factory while we had some extra time. This new case is sort of half way between hard and soft, you can really throw it about and it feels solid with the Pandora in it as it&#39;s well padded.<br />

I&#39;m not too keen on sending out those hard cases at all, they are very poor, and I don&#39;t want to give more business to that factory.

There is space for SD cards though. You can have 2 in the Pandora and 4+ in the top of the case.<br />
<br />
Another thing is when you look at the case with the Pandora in it it&#39;s pretty awesome to think there is basically a tiny laptop in there.

<br />
The interesting thing is, it&#39;s almost the same as the original iControlpad design. So I don&#39;t know why Craig thought his idea would work and theirs wouldn&#39;t :/.<br />
Edit: Zodttd even showed a video of the original iControlpad prototype working a while ago, I really don&#39;t know what Craig means here.</div></div><br />
<br />
Sorry, I thought craig&#39;s comments were directed towards the original Gamebone pictures - which they still very well may have been. I agree that I don&#39;t see why this design is impossible and iControlPad&#39;s isn&#39;t.</div></div><br />
<br />
Well we tried it (the original icontrolpad used that design) and it&#39;s a total mess.<br />
<br />
Just start to think about it - how do you hold the iphone in the design? How do you adjust for different iphones/touches? How do you get the signal from that dpad across the design to the serial port on the other side (2 PCBs? A ribbon Cable? A mess&#33;), where will they put the battery?<br />
<br />
The design does not work, if you forced it to it would be very expensive and assembly would also be expensive.<br />
<br />
Also it&#39;s huge, does not have room for nubs, the shoulders are probably not there due to the PCB issues of the layout.<br />
<br />
Etc. Etc.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a fake. Just look at the render - the buttons don&#39;t even line up, no way that&#39;s a CAD image - oh and I&#39;d love to see the tooling costs of that design - you&#39;re looking at well over &#036;100,000.

It chugs slowly out of the station and builds up speed before slowly getting to that final cruising speed.  They had to build more test jigs in Texas in order to test more boards simultaneously and that was only ordered recently after a very long and slow process of getting the procedure right (took longer than expected for reasons I won&#39;t get into).  Even though those thousand boards were built a while ago (whenever I mentioned it), testing them has been a slow process and as more test jigs get built and tested themselves (lots of soldering work and mechanical fitting of pieces, it&#39;s quite a complex rig), more human work stations can be set up to run the automated tests on them.<br />
<br />
Some of those first rev5 boards were being manually tested like they have done on prototype boards which involves typing in all commands manually and observing the results.  There&#39;s no way you would go through thousands and thousands that way but it had to be done so they could lose less time making sure their procedures were accurate and the boards were soldering properly.  As more test jigs are built, the process takes more of the human out of the equation.<br />
<br />
The idea is to automate as much as possible but a human still has to man the station and load the boards into the jig, run the software, plug in all the connectors, click Y to begin the test sequences, etc.  They are keeping their estimated yields low as they chug out of the station (ie. 500...then 500 more...then hopefully 1000, then another 1000, then the last 1000).<br />
<br />
ED tells you what we know today but that can change tomorrow.  The total time frame is not going to be known until it is basically all done.  ED has given the worst case but if we get things rolling smoothly, that time could start coming down more and more.  The part that is killing everyone is that if we just wanted to do a power on test of each board and ship them out, we could probably do all 4000 in a week (assuming cases arrive and man power is enough) but both the Pandora team and the assembler are not satisfied with such a thing and so every circuit on the board is being tested in an effort to shoot for a 0% RMA list after launch.  Imagine being that guy who finally gets his Pandora, tears open the box only to have to email support an hour later because a bunch of stuff won&#39;t work.  Nobody wants to be that person.  The trade off is time and a fair bit of it but if it means your Pandora runs solid for years instead of minutes, we&#39;ve got to do it.  There&#39;s just no other way.

No problem doing three wires for the spare shoulder buttons by taking just one ground from the spare pads.  I know you aren&#39;t suggesting using the already present stereo jack as some people are mentioning here, but I will say that the ground on the headphone connector should not be used for a ground on digital signals such as these spare shoulders as it is an isolated ground around the audio circuitry before joining the main ground.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not sure about finding room for a new jack but maybe you could creatively squeeze in a small 2.5mm jack somewhere.  The smaller the better.

I pulled it apart and found the datasheet for the battery on the internet.  It was actually 1350mAh or around there.  It sucked and it would just shut off when it got near low instead of allowing the PSP to warn the user that it was almost dead.<br />
<br />
Has anyone pointed out that the battery from the first post is 7.2V which would fry Pandora to a non-functioning crisp?<br />
<br />
Also, the Pandora battery was carefully designed to both fit the case properly and have all kinds of protection trip points to make sure you don&#39;t get hurt.  I&#39;d stick to the USB OTG port or DC adapter port for extended battery life using a supply that sticks very close to 5V.<br />

Actually the cost of populating the bare boards and testing them is now more expensive than talks I had with them dating back to spring 2008 when they were verbally agreeing to pricing we were budgeting for the entire build.  Basically, doing it ourselves is only preventing us from sinking into a deeper hole on these first couple of batches.<br />
<br />
The first batch is going to be the most expensive and we should be able to get the price down a bit for future batches.  There were a lot of setup costs and learning processes, plus some manual efforts that we can&#39;t automate until the next batch.  Still, it will never be as cheap as discussions from two years ago and we don&#39;t have the manpower to move assembly to China without wading through a possible disaster as the supervision required would probably out weigh the cost of still doing our small batches in the US (boards) and England (cases).

The idea is that software can check the time remaining under maximum load to see if it should cut the system off early because if you were to suddenly need that extra current, the battery would be too low to do it and data corruption could occur.  Since Pandora can be running at less than 300mA or need 1.5A if you were driving everything all out, this register isn&#39;t all that useful.  It&#39;s more for devices with no chance of jumping around much.  The battery warning would trip way too early if it was expecting 5x the current at any moment.<br />
<br />
Since there is no real way to know what the ideal value would be other than to put some crazy high number in there (ie: the USB host was being maxed out), I just put some value in that seemed like a good number under hard gaming only.  It was probably 600mA based on the readings but I don&#39;t remember right now.  It doesn&#39;t do anything if you don&#39;t write software to need it (which we don&#39;t) and it can be reprogrammed at any time since we don&#39;t seal the gauge for read only.<br />
<br />
The most accurate reading based on all my testing is the &quot;TimeToEmptyAtConstantPower&quot; and 12 hours is pretty cool although it dips down to 10ish when playing Hexen 2 (my new favorite) or something using 3D.

These cases will not have a silkscreen as that would push delivery out into April and even then Craig worried they would screw it up and stiff us with the cases.  The problem is the mold company outsources the work and so they all have to be packaged up carefully, sent to this other company, printed, repackaged carefully and sent back to the mold company to be shipped to Craig with everything else.  It could cause as much as another month of delays with the way we should trust them.<br />
<br />
I built a unit using a silk screened case and I really liked it but the truth is, 10 minutes after using it, the silkscreen is forgotten and you don&#39;t even notice it anymore.  The way you normally hold it in the 170 degree open position means you can&#39;t see any of it anyway.  The LEDs are also color coded so maybe that helps too.  The sticker under the battery with serial number and model number also has all the voltage and current details for the unit so in a way, not having that on the back is covered.  I don&#39;t know if any of this is comforting but it&#39;s an unfortunate result of a product that can&#39;t afford more delays.

The BRF6300 chip allows up to 4Mbps transfers but OMAP3 unfortunately only goes to 3Mbps so that is the rate.

My laptop then asked for a passcode so I typed 0000 which is the only default one I know.  Pandora didn&#39;t like that code and shut down the link and my laptop told me it was denied.

The greasy finish you mention is most probably due to excessive release agent used when running the mould for the first time (reduces the risk of the moulding sticking in the tool). <br />

if youre really considering this please mail me or thru boards PM</div></div><br />
Along the edge it looks like the plastic cracked off when being ejected and it happens in the same spot on all cases.  The holes are from the mechanical tooling blocks that slide in to make the little channels the clips sit inside.  They seem to be going too deep and there is almost no plastic left behind them and it collects around the edge while it cools.  I don&#39;t want to post a million pictures of damaging photos on my Photobucket account but a view from the inside shows the pattern in the plastic these blocks leave in the lid and behind this rounded wall.  I read your comments and I agree that the machine used this time around (or the regular guy was out sick?) did not line up the blocks properly or whatever mechanical error could be made.

They sent me seven cases.  Maybe they made 12-15 cases and these were the best of them.  From all I have read in my google searches, firing up the machines to only pump out cases, even in the dozens, cannot be considered reliable as the machines barely get up to temperature and proper mix rate...or something like that.  I don&#39;t know enough since I have never worked for a plastics company.  I do know that when they finally get around to making our test cases it is when they have scheduled machine time for us so it isn&#39;t likely they will wait hours for the machines to pump out perfect cases only meant for testing when they have bigger, more important (to them anyway) customers lined up next in the queue.<br />
<br />
To those few who say they work with or at molding companies, I welcome your opinions.  I think you get some heat for being so critically negative rather than just offering objective opinions.<br />
<br />
Isn&#39;t it ironic that the cases arriving on time Friday afternoon is turning out to be worse than if they were delayed until Monday because now we have to wait two days for an answer? :)

<br />
First, I am not looking for perfection.  That is an infinite process but there is such thing as a standard quality that any commercial device should meet.  I spent so much time perfecting the guts of this thing and it is a true insult to my efforts to see this mold company send me such incomplete samples and call them &#39;final&#39;.  We will find out what level of purity the plastic was that made these cases.  Maybe they know production plastic won&#39;t be swirled and greasy and so when they said we would be happy with these, they expected that we understood that.  Communication is a tough one when they refuse to hold conversations for more than three minutes at a time.  Don&#39;t ask me why they didn&#39;t put the silk screening on these parts because I was explicitly told they would have them.  More lies.<br />
<br />
There were a few more internal modifications for rev3 but most of the important ones came from the rev2 samples.  A couple of changes for rev3 that I am happy about are a tighter fit on the screws which makes them feel more secure and closing up the nub surround so that the PCB isn&#39;t visible around the nub under certain lighting conditions.  It also looks like they closed up a small gap in the lid that let a bit of backlight light shine through the front.  The LCD cable slot took a step backwards with a bit of unevenness but since it was right last time, we can assume that more carefully made production parts will be back to normal.<br />
<br />
The cases are still very solid.  You can try to twist and bend them but they don&#39;t flex much.  It will feel like a very solid device in your hands and functionally, everything works exactly as we want.  The gaming controls are perfect.  The keyboard is perfect and there has never been an issue with buttons getting stuck in the case or anything like that.  The problems now are cosmetic.  There are rough edges around the connectors, around the edges of that recessed channel in the front the SD cards, volume wheel, etc. and some on the edge of the base parts where the two halves go together.  There are some sink marks too which might hide a bit better with a full, proper matte finish but they&#39;re there.<br />
<br />
As some people have pointed out, a picture can say more than any amazing piece of software ever will and a reviewer crapping all over the case quality could spoil it for anyone considering the Pandora.  I&#39;m one of those people really.  These cases aren&#39;t a disaster but I would want something to show off to my friends and having to explain the colored patches and rough edges is a little defeating.<br />
<br />
Some pictures are posted on my photobucket and I&#39;m not too sure making a video will show better quality.  I will probably still make one anyway but unless I can really master the lighting, my 640x480 videos won&#39;t help you know if I&#39;m holding a rev1, 2 or 3 case.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Two more pages were written since typing this.  Ah yes, the hinge area.  There are clips in that area that hold the two halves tightly together and they screwed up somehow.  On this revision, the recessed spots for the clips to sit in got completely evacuated and there are holes right through the case.  They didn&#39;t do this on rev2.  Rev2 just had roughness on the bottom edges of these parts and not the destruction of the clip channels like this time.

<br />
The case fits, is totally functional and sturdy but it looks like the rev2 ones.  I don&#39;t know what the hell they were doing the past two months.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m also trying to find out if these were made from recycled plastic or new pellets.  Maybe that is why it still has rough edges and a greasy finish and a production run will be done differently.

Final parts don&#39;t get shipped like samples do which is crammed into plastic bags inside one big box.  Regardless of how many cases can be made next week, the limitation is on how many can be safely packaged and shipped.  That is why Craig wants to pick a reasonable number to ship before the CNY.

This is incredibly. It&#39;s probably the slowest Amiga emulation possible on the Pandora and already VERY playable.

Can&#39;t wait for a Cyclone-Version, this will easily fly away!
Thanks to Pickle for the quick port.</span></div></td>

<br></div>
<div style="font-size: 12px; margin: 3px 0px;"><span>I tried to compare the WIZ, PSP, F200 and Pandora-Display in regards of ghosting. As suspected, that can&#39;t be really done. The camera used was doing HD (720 with 50p) and the game usually runs at 60Hz which is way different.
You can see a BIT of a difference though. First you see the game in fullspeed and after that at 50% speed which makes the ghosting more visible.
As expected, ALL LCD have ghosting. In my opinion, the WIZ one (a OLED) is the best one regarding to ghosting (no surprise here). On second place if you only take a look at the ghosting is F200 and Pandora. However, F200 has weird colors and contrast (I tried to fix it with a color correction, but the colorspace seems weird here). Therefore, I like the Pandora one better.
While the PSP one basically has the same amount of ghosting, there is one thing that makes it look worse (can also be seen here in the video): The ghosting is very dark and therefore clearly visible.
The Pandora / F200 has a much lighter ghosting which makes it look like a motion blur (and that does make the games look similar as on 80s/90s CRTs) , whereas the PSP does look like it smears.

Both the Pandora one and WIZ one look sharper than the others. No surprise for the Pandora here, as its normal resolution is much higher (800x480).

So, which is the best LCD? It depends on what you want to do :)
The WIZ one is looking good but lores and small (and OLED still has some issues).
The Pandora one is nice with some ghosting visible, but actually looks like some motion blur.
Same for the F200, except for those scanlines and the bad colors / contrast.
The PSP one is bleeding colors, as is already known for a long time.</span></div></td>

Ohne Hacken oder eine illegale Firmware installieren zu m&uuml;ssen. Linux und OpenSource machen es m&ouml;glich. Zum Anwenden sind allerdings keine Linux-Kennnisse n&ouml;tig.

Die Spiele kann man einfach herunterladen, auf die SD-Karte kopieren und loslegen.

The WiFi issue - finally resolved</U></STRONG></P><P>A lot of guys have probably already followed this on the boards: notaz was working on the WiFi driver and still couldn''t get it to work reliable. As he didn''t know what else to try, he thought it could also be a hardware issue - of course, that got us alarmed. Michael immediately stopped the board production (700 had been produced so far back then) to first do more tests with WiFi. We were totally in the dark. If you ever wanted to know how sudden death feels... well, we do know for sure yet.</P><P>Michael did begin investigating the hardware while notaz did more tests and tweaks with the software. A kernel which disabled everything except WiFi did get a bit more speed out of the WiFi, but it still was very slow. Was it the driver causing problems when other stuff was running? Or was it the hardware? We still didn''t know for sure.<BR><BR>As we didn''t know, we decided we will get some WiFi sticks for the beginning and ask every customer whether he wanted to get the Pandora with a stick and internal WiFi that might be fixable by software or maybe needs a hardware fix later.<BR><BR>Then, at one time, we found out that WiFi was faster on Rev2/3 boards then on the recent Rev4/5 boards - pretty weird, as nothing had been changed in these revisions that could affect WiFi. Except the board manufacturer. Using that clue, we figured out that the impedance of one trace had been changed. The impedance is important here, as a wrong impedance will distort the signal and then the module doesn''t get a clean clock. Measuring the clock signal did prove that: Yep, the impedance had been changed.<BR>Who''s fault was it? Hard to tell. The company had changed that trace without asking, but we also didn''t explicitely say it needs to have a correct back. So it''s a hard thing, the trace is working, it was just not good enough for the signal.<BR>Knowing that, Michael did work on it for a couple of days, doing some trial and error (not much you can''t do unless you do know the exact new impedance).<BR>He got it working better - but still not good enough to really be usable - was this due to software? Or still hardware?<BR>So he started to work on a new testing board (Rev6) which could also be used as new board for the rest of the 3300 Pandoras if it fixes WiFi.<BR>While doing that, he had another idea - modded another Rev5 board and got a HUGE speed increase! On minimal kernel, he can get 350KB/s, on normal image he gets 66KB/s stable speed (tested downloading from the internet. That fix is easy: Simply piggyback a resistor on top of an existing one. Takes about 1 - 2 minutes. And the rest of the 3300 boards can be populated with the new resistor immediately, so that fix won''tl be needed on them.<BR>Speed can probably still be improved - Michael just found out about that yesterday, he will try to tweak more (or even combine the two mods) during the next days, until he leaves for UK to start assembling (he will do the modification of each board while assembling).<BR>Finally! That news did make us more alive again, we were really suffering during the last days...</P><P><BR></P><P><STRONG><U>2. The cases</U></STRONG></P><P>Since board production had been stopped for a while, we allowed the Chinese guys to tweak the case moulds a bit more. As you might have seen on the latest image, the bottom part (with the keyboard) looks spot-on right now - however, the top part still has some weird discoloration. No problem with stability here, just looks a bit weird if you look closely.</P><P><BR><STRONG><U>3. The OS - ready for first release</U></STRONG></P><P>The latest image had been tested a lot by all of us already. It is pretty stable, has some minor issues (like you need to restart after calibrating the touchscreen at the moment... no biggie, I only needed to calibrate once in the last four months).<BR>It has a working browser, eMail client, IRC, ICQ, MSN, etc. everything you need for normal life.<BR>There is room for speed improvement in the future, SDL is not using hardware surfaces yet, but that will follow.<BR>Also, boot process will be further optimized and will use Upstart to be a lot faster.<BR>If you don''t like a fancy desktop system, you can also use some minimal GUIs. We also designed that system to be configurable, so as soon as anyone codes a new GUI, it can easily be included by simply changing a config file.<BR><BR>The libpnd system is also working nicely: download a PND onto your SD Card and it will automatically appear in the menu (or on the desktop). Games will be sorted into categories, every dev can include a documentation in his PND so you can easily check the manual or installation settings, etc. Really convenient.<BR>Of course, the categories, icons, etc. can be overriden, in case you want to have your own ones.<BR>One thing you should not expect from the beginning is (as said before) accellerated movie playing (and therefore, also youtube movie playing).<BR>This does need a new kernel and is on our TO-Do list for the next firmware release, which will be worked on as soon as the first one is ready to go on the NAND.<BR>You can also help us testing then, as you can install the new beta image on an SD Card and try it out.</P><P>As the image is working well already, devs already concentrate to port more things. At the moment, we got fullspeed Amiga 500 emulation (without frameskip) at 500MHz, fullspeed Genesis and MegaCD, fullspeed C64 (Vice!) on 500 MHz without any frameskip, VCS2600, Colecovision, Atari ST, ... tons of stuff to play. Skeezix is also porting PocketSNES, so fullspeed SNES will also work when you get your unit.<BR>PandoraPanic (minigames created by members of the GP32x.com community) is working nice, FreeDink, some PyGame-Games, etc. have also been ported already.<BR></P><P>Overall, you will get a good working first release OS which still leaves a lot of room for improvements.</P><P>Â </P><P><U><STRONG>4. The current situation</STRONG></U></P><P>We lost two weeks due to that WiFi issue, but now that this has been resolved being a fixable hardware issue, Michael told the company yesterday to ship out all the produced boards we have as soon as possible to UK. Additionally, Fatih told the Chinese to do the same: Produce the cases as they are now and ship them!<BR>DJWillis is working on making the image NAND-installable, so yes, you might see us assembling them on webcam soon!<BR></P>');

Well, yeah, though the only one who mods those things is MichaelW, and currently he is trying to squeeze out more speed instead. His normal PC does still download a tad faster than the Pandora does, so there is room of improvement. notaz also wants to do the mod, and as soon as he did, he wants to do proper speed tests and maybe tweak the driver.<br />
<br />
Michael is a hardware genius, but not used to do any hardware benchmarking using software, so he would need time to find out and set up everything.<br />
Instead of doing this, he is rather working on the hardware until he hits the &quot;won&#39;t get faster because of my internet speed&quot;-limit.

<br />
Yep, the DESIGN of the case and board as well as software has mostly been done in the spare time - but that&#39;s over now.<br />
<br />
And assembly will not take place in spare time either, we gather a team which will work fulltime on assembling the stuff.<br />
<br />
So... let me see, we got approx. 200 days left until 2011 (already substracted a few days because of holidays, etc.)<br />
If we have 4000 Pandoras to build, that would mean that we shouldn&#39;t build more then 20 units a day. Since we are working something between 10 - 12 hours on assembling (maybe even more), that would mean no more than 2 units per hour.<br />
MichaelW made a video tutorial showing us how to assemble a Pandora. He does it really slow and repeats steps quite a few times to really show you how to do it.<br />
That does take 17 minutes.<br />
<br />
So if one person is working REALLY slow to build a Pandora, it takes 17 minutes - which would be a bit more than 3 units per hour.<br />
That&#39;s already too fast.<br />
<br />
We have at least 8 people assembling Pandoras - so how slow should they work?

<br />
Okay, then answer me these simple questions:<br />
1. How long does a team in an assembly line with 8 stations need to assemble a Pandora?<br />
2. Do you know the exact modifications we need to do to get WiFi fully working yet?<br />
3. Do you know if the cases that arrive in UK are perfectly fine and can be used without any modifications?<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t? Bummer, if I knew those, I could tell you how long it will take.<br />
<br />
Those are the things we don&#39;t know yet.<br />
As said multiple times (even in this thread):<br />
<br />
Answer to 1. Probably 3 - 12 minutes, speed will increase with assembly experience. There&#39;s no way yet to tell you how long it will take.<br />
Answer to 2. Well, as Michael is still tweaking, we don&#39;t know yet. As soon as we know, we can ask the company how long it will take to produce the rest of the boards. Before that anything is speculation<br />
Answer to 3. We&#39;ll find out as soon as they get there. Until then, there&#39;s no way we can tell you how long the rest will take.<br />
<br />
<br />
See the problem with your &quot;simple&quot; questions?<br />
They can only be answered when certain events took place.<br />
<br />
We will all know more after assembly has started. Not before.

<br />
Is the intention to assemble the remaining 3,300 in one go while in the UK from next week after the initial xxx are done?

No need asking questions over and over again that nobody can answer, is there?<br />

Longest time is probably taking assembly, so until we got a bit of routine assembling the Pandoras there&#39;s no way to tell how fast we can assemble.

Should I read this as that you believe 606 KB/s is a decent speed for 802.11g or that you&#39;re confident that the remaining speed improvements are all software related? <br />
<br />
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m very glad that MWeston managed to achieve a usable WiFi speed. However, we ordered a device with an 802.11b/g chip, not just an 802.11b.</div></div><br />
<br />
If you read the blog, you could see that MWeston only did tests with normal internet yet (5Mbps line, as I know now), so he as long as he doesn&#39;t setup a connection between his server and the Pandora, he probably can&#39;t squeeze out more of it.<br />
He is also still working on tweaking and managed speed doubling in about four hours.<br />
<br />
Until all tests have been finished, we can&#39;t say more about that.<br />
<br />
If the speed is not sufficient enough for you, you probably need to wait for a later revision.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s enough for normal internet surfing, video streaming, Audio streaming, Messenging, etc.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I do wonder what you guys are planning to do with your Pandora...?

In best case, yes. However, there was a stability issue that caused the cases to be delayed until 26th (I did post that somewhere in a thread).<br />

That does work already, yes.<br />
<br />
However, even mouse emulation for Amiga / Atari ST, etc. COULD be done using touchscreen.<br />
It&#39;s just that someone needs to code it.<br />
<br />
i.e. you could remember where you last touched the screen and calculate a movement for the Amiga mouse when you touch the touchscreen at a new spot.<br />
Then the emulator needed to simulate a mouse movement as fast as possible between those two spots.<br />
<br />
Another thing might be manipulating the cursor directly in the Amiga RAM.<br />
AFAIR the mouse on the Amiga could move itself, that does mean there should be an area where the current position of the mousepointer is stored.<br />
So you could directly manipulate that using the touchscreen values.

We just discovered the fault, let&#39;s just give us a day at least to make all figures and tell you then.<br />

The mod fix takes about 2 minutes per board, so the new delay will approximately be 1400 minutes (as 700 boards had been produced so far).<br />
Of course, there was the delay until we discovered what was wrong, but that&#39;s over already.<br />

Is that right? My impression was that applications that are not touch-screen aware will receive normal mouse events.</div></div><br />
<br />
That&#39;s not possible, as a mouse MOVES whereas a touchscreen can be touched anywhere so the mouse cursor jumps immediately to that direction.<br />
<br />
In X, the input driver takes care of that, so all normal X apps can work with a touchscreen.<br />
However, for emulation like DosBox, Atari ST, Amiga, etc. this won&#39;t work.<br />
The original system is not aware of a touchscreen, so it cannot let the mouse cursor jump around, it can only move it like it was a mouse.<br />
<br />
Currently, the mouse cursor moves when you move the cursor around with the touchscreen - but it&#39;s not aware when you remove the pen and put it to a different spot. It will not move the mouse pointer there.<br />
Can be fixed, but needs some work.

Balls. You&#39;re just going to put him on a learning curve so hard he will be put off, and when I moved from Basic to C it took me about 10mins to learn the difference. Once you can code in any major language it&#39;s piss easy to pick up another, so why not start with an easy one?<br />
<br />
(and I can code in ASM, C, Perl, Basic, Pascal, Java etc. etc.)<br />
<br />
What I found the most fun for a challenge was Z80 ASM, I used to love that (Gameboy, Arcade emu), but I think he should start with something like Basic and move on to other languages later.<br />
<br />
Depending on what he wants to do, Basic might be all he needs.

Yes of course in my post it was under the assumption that he was replacing the resistor. I don&#39;t know what kind of tools he has available. But I think that it might take longer to do them when you&#39;re doing 500 straight than if you were doing just a few. My figure was for about 10 minutes.. an assumption of less than 1 minute each and doing that for over 8 hours straight is a bit much, especially when that&#39;s supposed to be the extreme end in time&#33; These people are not machines...<br />
<br />
Yeah it&#39;s faster than the overall process but it&#39;s still an extra overhead, which is why I asked if more than MWeston is going to be doing it (because that&#39;s not what was implied). ED says a few minutes, going to assume it&#39;s not a big deal with the rest of the assembly process but unless they have more people it&#39;ll still add a little time overhead.</div></div><br />

Also, the KP_BL pads can sink 160mA and the source is the battery directly.  The + side is the battery and the - side is the FET in the TPS65950 sinking the current with PWM control available.  As you can tell, that means no current limiting so 160mA is the safe number but you have to use resistors to be sure you don&#39;t fry anything yourself.

The resistor was the series resistance in the oscillator driver.  I did change it once on a previous revision but since there were no complaints back in the day, I kept it larger for lower current consumption.  The wifi clock requires a very strict clock profile so I had to decrease this resistance to drive the crystal harder (larger voltage swing), increase the bandwidth and put the crystal into a tighter range around resonance.  It probably means an extra mA or two of constant current drain so not a big issue in that respect.

It just passes &quot;mouse moved left X points&quot;, &quot;mouse moved up Y points&quot;, etc...<br />
By contrast, a touchscreen is a direct X/Y system.<br />
What needs to happen in order to work with the Amiga emulator is to somehow take the exact positions that the touchscreen provides and translate them to relative positions for the amiga programs.  If different programs have different mouse &quot;resolutions&quot;, then this will be even more difficult.<br />
In short, possible, but only after a lot of work and experimentation.</div></div><br />
<br />
Yes, it&#39;s perfectly possible - if I&#39;ve done it for a speccy mouse (which uses the same mechanism as an amiga mouse, but with interrupts for directional movements) then it can be done for the Amiga. Each app which uses the mouse will need to be patched. As everyone will be using a Workbench, it will be a good place to start adding a patch to the ROM libs to utilise a touchscreen. From there, you&#39;ll have to patch individual games but it shouldn&#39;t be too hard, and there&#39;s not many games that will need it - mouse controlled games were far outnumbered by those controlled by joystick or keys.<br />
<br />
D.</div></div><br />
<br />
I find this solution to be unlikely at best.<br />
<br />
Thousands of games, hundreds of which used the mouse somewhere in them, then you have to work out how each program stored the mouse coords (that won&#39;t be a fun job), then see if the program will actually allow you to poke in a new value/patch without some kind of ancient copy protection kicking in, then work out a way of having the emulator identify which game needs which patch and when it needs the patch (those memory locations may well be used for something else when the mouse isn&#39;t on the screen) ... urgh... it&#39;s getting messy...

<br />
I think you&#39;re going to be eating your words if an OMAP4 device comes out over a year earlier than you project. If TI doesn&#39;t plan on having OMAP4 ready to market in 2010 then they&#39;d probably may as well just exit the market - Tegra 2 can be obtained <em class=''bbc''>today</em>. NEC and NXP have also both announced Cortex-A9 SoCs. With A9 being announced all the way back in 2007 my guess is that some companies skipped out on A8 altogether.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#39;t judge the OMAP4 release cycle based on OMAP3, which was still the first Cortex-A8 SoC to market after all the time it took to release. TI did claim it&#39;d be sampling in 2010.</div></div><br />
<br />
Being able to buy it does not mean it&#39;s ready. The software needs to be mature too. I think it will take just as long as the OMAP3 has.

I used to think my first 2400bps (i.e. 2.4k) modem was the dog&#39;s bollocks after using a friend&#39;s 1200 baud. Twice as fast - wow&#33; It couldn&#39;t possibly get much faster than that...</div></div><br />
<br />
2.4k? Wishful thinking, you mean (approx) 0.3k.<br />

I thought I was the &#39;man&#39; when, for my 13th birthday I got a 28.8k modem, imported from the USA. Shame no other bloody person in the UK had one and I had to use it at 14.4k for about a year&#33;

<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>Wafers are probed for certain tests. Then they are packaged and fully tested. That is the point at which the binning is done. No SW is run on the devices. They are basically clocked and the timing is checked.<br />
<br />
All this means is that these devices are the fastest possible and will work over the full temp range.<br />
<br />
They test all the parts the same, it just means if the data is better in some areas, it goes into a different box.</div></div><br />
<br />
So as I think myself or someone has mentioned in the past, overclocking a 720 (or even just running at 720) will run cooler than a chip sold as a 600 at the same speed.  The speculation begins as to whether it means everyone can overclock the same as long as you stay in an temperature controlled environment like an office or house where 25C is attainable.  Further speculation based on the Motorola Droid, Palm Pre and Nokia N900 overclock tests suggests that the silicon can gate the data at overclocked speeds but these devices run considerably warmer when pushed so it is unknown if the extra heat will eventually mean their death.  <br />
<br />
If they have 600MHz chips inside, then it is likely they are running hotter than if they are sold with 720 chips.  I don&#39;t know how much hotter the difference is.  It could be as insignificant as 1 degree celcius or it could be 20 degrees (that sounds a bit extreme&#33;).  There&#39;s probably more breathing room in the Pandora case than these phones so that might also benefit overclocking.  Also, since the POP stack on the Pandora PCB is on the bottom side, during normal usage (not setting the unit upside down on your table) all 515 balls will pass the heat of the CPU up to the PCB and dissipate through the copper planes instead of getting trapped in the RAM chip and having to pass through it to the air.  I have no data to suggest this will provide any significant benefit but it seems better than overheating the RAM chip&#33;

my apologies for not updating the site a lot. That WiFi issue really did
 wear me out, I wasn''t able to do much during that time. We all were a 
bit demotivated, but now that WiFi''s working, we''ve recovered and are 
working fullspeed ahead!<br />Sorry for that, but after all, we''re only 
human beings, too... and after years of constant work on the Pandora and
 our normal jobs... well, things can get a bit hard.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>1.
 The hardware</b></p><p>Michael has finished working on WiFi and 
did manage to get it working quite well. Stable websurfing at about 500 
KB/s. He tried webbrowsing, streaming music, etc.<br />This put our minds 
on ease, we really were quite scared when we found out about WiFi.<br />We
 now got <b>FULLY WORKING HARDWARE</b>, as we got drivers for 
EVERY component!<br /><br />As can be seen on this picture, there''s a lot of
 boxes shipping to UK. Some might go to Turkey, as Fatih got hold of a 
company who usually does laptop repairs, and they might help to fix the 
WiFi on the already produced 700 boards to speed things up a bit.</p><p>{phocagallery
 view=category|categoryid=17|imageid=154}</p><p>This whole WiFi issue 
did throw as back a few weeks - but I hope you all do agree it''s better 
we took the two weeks finding out what the problem was. Otherwise, you 
would''ve been gotten Pandoras with broken WiFi... not a good idea, if 
you ask me.<br />This seemed to happen for a big, well-known company whose
 latest product has serious WiFi issues (and WiFi working much worse 
than ours...)<br />We rather ship you something working - even if it did 
delay things by two or three more weeks!<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>2.
 The cases</b></p><p>While Michael was working on WiFi, the Chinese
 were working on increasing the case quality.<br />And we really do think 
it was worth the extra time - especially the final one that has some 
paint added looks spot-on!<br />Way better than anything we''ve seen 
before!</p><p>{phocagallery view=category|categoryid=19|imageid=153}</p><p>Just
 compare that to an older version of the case...</p><p>{phocagallery 
view=category|categoryid=21|imageid=155}</p><p>Was it worth it? &nbsp;That''s 
up to decide for yourself. We sure do think so.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 
adding paint did lead to one thing that has to be done: As it makes the 
case a bit thicker, Michael needs to approve that case and therefore is 
waiting for a sample.<br />To speed production up, Fatih will visit the 
company in China if necessary to make sure they won''t mess around more 
but start shipping!<br />They still have a few days to ship, as applying 
the WiFi fix to the boards will take a while.</p><p>One thing that might
 interest you: You might have seen that they also painted a pink version
 of the Pandora... Michael will most probably put a Rev 4 board in and 
sell it on eBay soon!<br />Yep, that Prototype will probably be out 
shortly before we assemble and ship!<br /><br />{phocagallery 
view=category|categoryid=21|imageid=156}</p><p><b>So if you want to
 own this case, keep your eyes on our blog!</b></p><p>Oh, some 
might think Painting is cheating... well, not really.<br />A lot of 
companies actually do it that way - and it doesn''t wear off. Remember 
the old Nintendo DS? Not the DS Lite, but the old silvergrey one? I got 
one. Never had a carry case, it''s really scratched (even the LCD is 
scratched).<br />But only on one corner it can be seen it''s painted - and 
only because the base plastic color was white.<br />So black with black 
won''t wear off - don''t worry. It will simply LOOK better.<br /><br /><br /><b>3.
 The software</b></p><p>I''m currently doing a lot of neat scripts 
while DJWillis prepare the image for the NAND.<br />Today I did create an 
LCD Gamma Manager - a small tool where you can create, load and save 
various LCD Gamma settings. I also created one that looks like an old 
CRT TV. Really cool - emulation on a handheld has never looked better!<br /><b>To
 check out what''s happening on the OS, simply go to 
http://git.openpandora.org&nbsp;</b></p><p>As Midori was a bit unstable 
and FireFox eating up RAM, we changed browsers once again. Arora is now 
included in the OS. Fast, without any rendering issues and it didn''t 
crash yet for me.&nbsp;<br />The OS is getting more and more complete.</p><p><br /></p><p>That''s
 it for now - as soon as I know any more information (shipping dates for
 the cases, dates when we all meet in England, etc.), I''ll inform you!<br />And
 sorry to my German readers: I''ll translate the post tomorrow, it''s 5:50
 am now, I want to go to bed... :)</p>');

You can&#39;t sell any contracts. You can sell the device - and if you sell somebody a device, you usually get the invoice he got. For warranty, this is no big deal, but if the new buyer wants to use it for tax returns, etc., he simply can&#39;t.

Yep. In my opinion it&#39;s a nice and cool device on-the-go :) <br />
I&#39;m also continuing my support for it, will probably meet up with GPH next month at a gaming expo in Korea and also talk about FunGP (as I might do the english customer support).<br />
<br />
The Pandora is a very cool device, but if you just want to play games up to SNES or stuff like ScummVM or nice little homebrew games, the WIZ is perfectly fine. Cheaper and smaller.<br />
If you want the big thing, go for the Pandora - but it also does cost twice as much.<br />
<br />
So far, the Pandora has done the WIZ good. A lot of press releases lead people to my website and with the Pandora gaining publicity, WIZ sales went up.

Okay, I just made some phonecalls. I couldn&#39;t get any official authorities who take care that everything conforms the CE on the phone yet, but will probably tomorrow (they&#39;re out of office already).<br />
I reached some guys from testing labs though. They know that there was an application to expand the CE frequencies so that WiFi will also need CE. However, they were not sure when this expandation will become valid (it might even be valid). I sent an email to official authorities to send me more information about that.<br />
<br />
I also talked to a few lawyers: As long as we don&#39;t sell WITHIN US, we&#39;re not responsible for FCC. The one who buys from us and IMPORTS the Pandora is responsible. The buyer makes the contract with us in EU, therefore the laws of EU are valid and no FCC is needed here.<br />
<br />
Still we want to make the FCC certification so that you all can import it without any hazzles. But as that can only be done with a finished unit, we have to wait 1 - 2 weeks before we can do it.<br />
<br />
We could also disable the WiFi module for the units we ship to USA and clearly state in the manual that you should not install any software that reenables it.<br />
<br />
However, that&#39;s not what we want. We want a completely certified and approved Pandora, but that won&#39;t happen before we have some final units. But it&#39;s planned.

And they confirmed me multiple times that CE doesn&#39;t care about WiFi.<br />
Nevertheless, the big FCC test is still coming and planned as soon as we get the first mass produced devices (I also mentioned that a few times back then).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, for FCC, you have to wait for the first mass produced devices - which we will have in 1 - 2 weeks.<br />
That means that the big test which will get us ALL certifications needed will probably ake place while we&#39;re assembling.<br />
<br />
There are companies like TUEV Nord in Germany that are specialized on testing and getting all the certifications you need to sell it in whatever area you tell them.<br />
Those tests do cost a LOT of money (approx. 10-20k EUR), therefore, we planned that testing as soon as we get the first mass produced units.<br />
<br />
BTW: That resistor didn&#39;t change anything in the WiFi area. The WiFi chip was working well before, it reported a very good signal quality. And transmitting WiFi was ALWAYS working and didn&#39;t have anything to do with the resistor.<br />
The only thing the resistor did change was the steepness of the curve for the module to sync the WiFi RECEPTION. The module was receiving everything, but it wasn&#39;t in sync with the board and therefore we had packet loss.<br />
<br />
The WiFi RX / TX itself hasn&#39;t been changed by that resistor.

It&#39;s called &quot;Self Declaration&quot;<br />

If we certificate it, it&#39;s fine. WE are the ones responsible for assuring it does pass CE. There is NO ONE else who can do a certification for you.<br />
<br />
If you include a CE certification within your product, you are claiming you tested the device and made sure it is within all of the given CE specs.<br />
If it&#39;s not the case and a test or some problems do reveal this, you are responsible for it.<br />
The test basically is optional, but it would be madness selling a device telling it conforms the CE without testing it.<br />
<br />
There is no such thing invalid CE certification.<br />
<br />
No need to retest it, though, as the only critical thing that didn&#39;t pass EMV was the LCD cable, so it had to be shielded (very common problem with such devices).<br />
That resistor doesn&#39;t change anything there, so I can assure you it&#39;s still within the specs.<br />
<br />
As soon as we got enough money, we will go for a big test that includes ALL testing for everything needed worldwide, but that&#39;s VERY expensive.<br />
Until then, we did what he had to do to sell it legally - do CE, as we are sitting in Europe.

What I didn&#39;t like about the post was that &quot;unauthorised&quot;.<br />
We did make clear that the Pandora has to be paid in advance because the actual costs are used for production and parts - and we surely couldn&#39;t have done it with that money.<br />
So that money was not unauthorised - as we didn&#39;t take that money away from anyone, it was the choice of each user to take the risk and pay us - or not.<br />
<br />
Also, no interest rate does help us. The parts have been delivered and paid in 2008 / 2009, we don&#39;t get a single cent out of interest.<br />
<br />
Some posts sound to me like we would be some big bad company intentionally delaying the Pandora... and that&#39;s what makes me sad.<br />
We&#39;re still just a bunch of humans, trying to do everything we can to deliver it as fast as we can. That&#39;s it.<br />

I&#39;m dissapointed it&#39;ll have a repaired PCB and paint to cover up the quality of the plastic.</div></div><br />
<br />
Well, and that&#39;s what you get. Oh, and we NEVER said you have to pay when you get it. It was clear from the VERY BEGINNING that you have to pay in advance.<br />
Please never open up any of your devices, you&#39;ll find A LOT of modifications, especially on first release devices. And even if you don&#39;t find some - that doesn&#39;t mean it hasn&#39;t been done, as you cannot see that a resistor has been replaced if it was done properly.<br />
<br />
The PCB will not bee repaired, the PCB is fine. There is simply one resistor that needs to have another value and that one is being replaced. That&#39;s a common thing to do.<br />
<br />
The quality of the plastic is fine, it&#39;s sturdy, it doesn&#39;t break, there is no problem. But due to the nature of moulding, some things can be seen through the case.<br />
You think painting is covering up? Hell, I did check a few devices I own at home.<br />
My mobile phone is painted. My notebook is painted. My Nintendo DS is painted. Even my Logitech mouse does use paint. Just because you don&#39;t know there is no paint doesn&#39;t mean it is not there.<br />
<br />
Speaking of GPH:<br />
The GP2X First Edition did have a wrong resistor. However, those were delivered with the wrong resistor (leading to much too dark colors and flickering LCDs) and I had to change them all afterwards.<br />
We could&#39;ve done so with the WiFi resistor, however, we chose to fix it before delivery. Do you think that&#39;s wrong?<br />
<br />
And by design and technical flaws from GPH products, we were talking about stuff like...<br />
<br />
* Unusable stick for gaming (GP2X F100)<br />
* DPAD not that great either (GP2X F200)<br />
* Wrong type of LCD used (240x320 instead of 320x240, leading to tearing or workarounds)<br />
<br />
That&#39;s something the Pandora certainly doesn&#39;t suffer from.<br />
So yeah, you still get exactly the same what we announced you will get when you ordered.<br />

Yeah, Sony Ericsson (Phone) and Thomson (Cable Receiver) seems like a bad choice.<br />

While it is sad you cancel, I can&#39;t say anything against it, as you probably aren&#39;t the user the first batch was intended for.<br />
The first batch is mainly for fans of homebrew and opensource, geeks and similar folks who don&#39;t care if the software doesn&#39;t run 100% from the beginning.<br />
The hardware will be fine, we fixed everything up, so there&#39;s no problem anymore.<br />

Well, with that attitude - certainly&#33;</div></div><br />
<br />
It&#39;s not about attitude - in fact, I think our attitude is fine here, as we ARE fixing up everything before we ship.<br />
<br />
Show me ONE recent device that didn&#39;t have problems with the first release edition... I can&#39;t find many (except for simple devices)<br />
<br />
iPad? Suffers WiFi problems (just check google)<br />
Sony PSP? Also had troubles (terrible LCD, buttons were squeaking, etc.)<br />
XBox360? Tons of them suffered the Red Ring of Death.<br />
<br />
Those are all devices from multi billion dollar companies.<br />
They couldn&#39;t do it right - even with A LOT more people working on it and A LOT more money to build such thing.<br />
<br />
Now here we are. A bunch of guys trying to create the best OpenSource handheld gaming device available. And I think we did well. Even the prototype case is sturdy and fine. The hardware is fast enough to run a full desktop without lagging.<br />
The gaming controls work perfectly, way better than on any other handheld I own.<br />
<br />
You were able to follow our steps, our trials, our problems. We did fix EVERYTHING there was, did try to do our best. In our sparetime. With very little money. If we were multi billion dollar companies, we could&#39;ve produced those cases outside of China. They would&#39;ve been finished long ago and probably would look perfect. I&#39;m really sorry I do not have a few million dollar lying around. I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re just some normal guys trying as hard as we can creating the Pandora. Maybe you did expect some gods. Well, we are no gods. And we never claimed we are.<br />
<br />
Still, looking at the market, I do think we did extremely well with the Pandora. Whereever I have a presentation with my prototype, it interests a lot of people and they would buy it instantly if I had some with me.<br />
We fixed everything BEFORE delivery, I honestly do think that&#39;s not something to be blamed for.<br />
<br />
If you do think so - well, I can&#39;t help it. I can&#39;t do miracles.<br />
<br />
<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>My mobile phone cannot do WiFi. It&#39;s a mobile phone, not a handheld computer. I could maybe do a test on my netbook though, if you really want to see if 500KB/s is a reasonable expactation from a chipset that specifies what, 54 Mb/s? (your web site says it is 802.11b/g, which should be able to go faster, I propose, than 500KB/s).</div></div><br />
<br />
It should go faster and it can probably go faster, yes.<br />
A netbook is bigger, it has more power.<br />
I talked to some other guys regarding that issue, as similar sized devices also won&#39;t go faster:<br />
The reason they do 802.11g is that no other devices are slowed down.<br />
<br />
A normal router cannot do 802.11b and 802.11g at the same time. So if a device connects with 802.11b, it would slow down ALL traffic for ALL devices, as the router always switches to the connection of the slowest device.<br />
<br />
Most devices that do have our size won&#39;t go higher than 900KB/s.<br />
This can be due to various reasons: One reason would be to save power (as small devices don&#39;t have such big batteries as netbooks) and the other reason is the bus / cpu / RAM, etc.<br />
Just because the module can make a througput of maybe 5MB/s doesn&#39;t mean the CPU or bus system can&#39;t process all of it.<br />
You can&#39;t compare your netbook to a small ARM CPU. The OMAP is very powerful, yes, but still slower than an ARM is.<br />
One thing we know is that the CPU speed affects the WiFi speed on our unit. Increasing the CPU does increase the WiFi speed and vice versa.<br />
And in minimal mode, the WiFi speed is even faster, maybe because the CPU doesn&#39;t need to power an X Server.<br />
<br />
Even the WiFi stick I did use didn&#39;t go higher than 900KB/s - and that one supports 802.11n.<br />
<br />
So yes, you get what you paid for: 802.11b/g<br />
But that doesn&#39;t mean you can always automatically expect full speed with it.<br />
Most devices in that form factor can&#39;t provide much more.<br />
<br />
We can probably reach that 900KB/s by working more on the software - but I doubt we will ever squeeze much more out of it.<br />

<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>Please take an unauthorised loan from me for two years. Oh, wait... you did/ After promising that you wouldn&#39;t.</div></div><br />
<br />
You&#39;re trying to compare approx. 300 EUR to about 500.000 USD? Wow.<br />
<br />
And what unauthorised loan? You paid for the device, we clearly said that the money will be used to actually produce the Pandora and you could always cancel your order.<br />
There was nothing unauthorised.<br />
There were some people who did cancel their order and they got their money back.<br />
<br />
Complaining about stuff that has been said from the very beginning is dumb.<br />
<br />
<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>However, using the cheapest possible source for everything does not guarantee the highest possible quality result. Take the Chinese plastics factory you are using. How has that worked out for you? Or even the specific chinese PCB vendor you used? Have they worked as well as the USA company that you did the prototyping with? My issue isn&#39;t with you getting stuff made in China. My issue is with you sayign that you wouldn&#39;t get stuff made CHEAPLY in China, but made to high quality in America, and THEN going and getting stuff made CHEAPLY in China. You get what you pay for.</div></div><br />
<br />
Well, every moulding company outside of China did want at least 10x as much money for the job. Yes, we would&#39;ve loved to do that - however, if there is no money, you don&#39;t have that option.<br />
<br />
We did say that we WON&#39;T DO the main production in China, and yes, in fact, that&#39;s what we did. And we did say that we try to do as little as possible in China - and that&#39;s also what we did.<br />
We did source the prices for producing outside and it would&#39;ve meant that one Pandora would&#39;ve cost at least 600 - 700 EUR each.<br />
<br />
The production itself is still being done in Texas, as the population of the boards is the most critical part.<br />
BTW: That the production of the PCBs happens in China is not because we said so. We don&#39;t even know WHO produces the PCBs, as we did place our order for the PCBs and the population with the US company in Texas. They are working together with a Chinese partner company, and they produce the PCBs.  And yes, they have worked as well as the USA company we did the prototyping with. The quality of the PCBs is top-notch. The changed impedance of one trace is something we didn&#39;t specifically tell them it shouldn&#39;t change, so this could&#39;ve happened with any other company, too. And in the end it turned out the impedance doesn&#39;t do much - it was a resistor with a wrong value, and that&#39;s nothing anyone else except for us was responsible.<br />
<br />

<p class=''citation''>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class=''quote''>Ah, the wife is home now. so I can type here and say to her at the same time - EvilDragon recommends that we get a full refund.</div></div><br />
<br />
I never recommended that you do so - I just told you the truth about our device and what I do think about the situation.<br />
<br />
If you have problems with devices which have some flaws at the beginning, you should NEVER be an early adopter. That&#39;s not specifically for the Pandora, that&#39;s the fact for EVERY device out there.<br />
I love to be an early adopter, I can live with flaws or even did fix quite a few myself by opening up and modding some devices. But if you 100% a fully flawless device regarding hardware and software, you should NEVER ever buy ANY new device that&#39;s just been released, be it from Apple, Sony, Microsoft or anyone else.<br />

Why is FireFox not the default browser? Because it uses too much RAM?????<br />
I barely even care about FireFox - except how it figures into what we&#39;re being told. The last I heard about browser OpenPandora were pleased as punch that the Pandora ran FireFox - and so well&#33; The next I notice FireFox has been replaced because it is too RAM hungry (after being told no-one would ever need more than 640KB) and its replacement is being replaced because it was too unstable. There seems to be no stability of vision to a product which is already a year and a half late.<br />
A year and a half ago it would have shipped with FireFox. So... that would have been a bad decision, yes?</div></div><br />
<br />
It does run very well for a mobile device. It&#39;s definately fast enough to be usable by anyone. But why use a bloated sluggish browser if there are FASTER ones?<br />
FireFox NEVER was the default or only browser on the system. Midori was there from the very beginning, and we just scrapped FireFox because...<br />
<br />
1. it&#39;s slower than other, faster browsers and needs more RAM than others<br />
2. it needs a lot of space on the NAND, and we want the user to decide what to do with the space<br />
3. it can be reinstalled with a single command if one specifically wants it<br />
<br />
Except for some extensions, I cannot find a single reason why people would want to use FireFox over any other faster working browser on the Pandora.<br />
For me, FireFox is too slow on my fast desktop PC (Intel T7500). I use Opera and / or Midori.<br />
<br />
So, could you please tell a single reason (me now that I explained this to you) why FireFox should stay on the system a default browser?<br />
<br />
Arora is faster, needs less RAM, does display all websites flawlessly (same rendering engine as FireFox), has an Adblocker, can also do tabbed browsing, has a private mode.<br />
The only thing it CAN&#39;T do is use extensions or special scripts. Unless you seriously need them, there&#39;s no need to use FireFox.

<br />
Example .. Pandora Emugui<br />
<br />
default options included/hooked to the Pandora self functions<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Other Media - lets you play radio/music in the background<br />
display - filters - screen size - gama/brightness - backlight<br />
controls - anologs ,core buttons - keys/maping<br />
power settings - overclock/underclock<br />
savestates - game saves<br />
<br />
there could be more default options specific to the Pandora and that would make a menu gui like this even more of a great idea on the Pandora.</div></div><br />
<br />
Well, a BASIC GUI for all emulators shouldn&#39;t be so hard, as most of them do support command lines.<br />
So showing roms from various directories and runnning them using an emulator is easy. The rest (mapping, etc.) depends on the emulator.<br />
<br />
Power settings (overclocking / underclocking) can already be done with the included PXML file :)
