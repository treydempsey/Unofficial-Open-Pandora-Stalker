      <description><![CDATA[Yep, just try using Spectrum/Amiga (etc.) emulators on the GP2X. It&#39;s a frustrating experience. So many games require you to do the odd key press here and there. Almost all spectrum games will initially require some kind of key press to set up the controls.<br />And that&#39;s just games, the Pandora is a real portable computer too - imagine not having a keyboard on your PC/Mac. <br />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[There&#39;s a big box of test cases arriving with me tomorrow afternoon (according to UPS at this very moment, subject to change, all rights reserved, patent pending, copyright 2010, we reserve the right to change at any time, your mileage may vary, items may be larger than they appear). :D <br />I have no idea if the pink one will be in there. It&#39;s a bigger shipment though: 1.40Kgs. Should be several cases and I know there will be painted and painted + silk screened cases in there. <br />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Well, the seller can change the shipping adress, but all additional costs (i.e. higher shipping costs) need to be covered by him.<br />The invoice adress won&#39;t change, since he is the one who made the contract with the distributor (which is me in that case), so the eBay buyer would receive the Pandora but get an invoice with the adress of the other guy.<br />You can&#39;t sell any contracts. You can sell the device - and if you sell somebody a device, you usually get the invoice he got. For warranty, this is no big deal, but if the new buyer wants to use it for tax returns, etc., he simply can&#39;t. <br />]]></description>

      <title>Wiz After Pandora Release</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<a class="snapback" rel="citation" href="http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?app=forums&module=forums&section=findpost&pid=840216"></a><br />Yep. In my opinion it&#39;s a nice and cool device on-the-go :) <br />I&#39;m also continuing my support for it, will probably meet up with GPH next month at a gaming expo in Korea and also talk about FunGP (as I might do the english customer support).<br />The Pandora is a very cool device, but if you just want to play games up to SNES or stuff like ScummVM or nice little homebrew games, the WIZ is perfectly fine. Cheaper and smaller.<br />If you want the big thing, go for the Pandora - but it also does cost twice as much.<br />So far, the Pandora has done the WIZ good. A lot of press releases lead people to my website and with the Pandora gaining publicity, WIZ sales went up. <br />]]></description>

      <title>Ce Certification Now Invalid?</title>

It&#39;s just not that easy to do everything correct from the very beginning. We&#39;re trying to do that - the most important thing is that we need first final units though. <br />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<a class="snapback" rel="citation" href="http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?app=forums&module=forums&section=findpost&pid=840183"></a><br />;) We do :P <br />Okay, I just made some phonecalls. I couldn&#39;t get any official authorities who take care that everything conforms the CE on the phone yet, but will probably tomorrow (they&#39;re out of office already).<br />I reached some guys from testing labs though. They know that there was an application to expand the CE frequencies so that WiFi will also need CE. However, they were not sure when this expandation will become valid (it might even be valid). I sent an email to official authorities to send me more information about that.<br />I also talked to a few lawyers: As long as we don&#39;t sell WITHIN US, we&#39;re not responsible for FCC. The one who buys from us and IMPORTS the Pandora is responsible. The buyer makes the contract with us in EU, therefore the laws of EU are valid and no FCC is needed here.<br />Still we want to make the FCC certification so that you all can import it without any hazzles. But as that can only be done with a finished unit, we have to wait 1 - 2 weeks before we can do it.<br />We could also disable the WiFi module for the units we ship to USA and clearly state in the manual that you should not install any software that reenables it.<br />However, that&#39;s not what we want. We want a completely certified and approved Pandora, but that won&#39;t happen before we have some final units. But it&#39;s planned. <br />]]></description>
